Code for paper: Unified Gradient- and Intensity-Discriminator Generative Adversarial Network for Image Fusion.

This work can be applied for:
  1. infrared and visible image fusion
  2. medical image fusion 
  3. multi-focus image fusion
  4. multi-exposure image fusion
  
  
Later, we will release our model and update some code.
